# CADD Microsystems Netsuite Extension

## About
A browser extension designed to extend the functionality of Netsuite in ways previously thought not possible. Many quality of life improvements for various pages including:

*Auto Page Refresh
*Calendar Color Highlighting System
*Case Numbers in Window Titles
*Stale Case Notification/Warning
*Customized Email Subject Strings
*Many more!

## Installation
### Chrome
Install from the [Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cadd-microsystems-netsuit/lbikfkkmcnnllacofaepnijkmicohban "CADD Microsystems Netsuite Extension")



### Firefox
Step one:
Launch Firefox and Open the Add-ons page:
 
Step Two:
Drag and drop the .xpi file you downloaded into the Firefox window (sometimes you have to then click “into” the window again for it to recognize the drag and drop). Then Click add!
 
Let me know what you guys think! There have already been a few request for additional functionality that I think I’ll be able to work about, so ideas are always welcome as well! I’d like to push this out to a larger audience once we test it a bit more, so your comments are much needed!


## Usage
Most of the items are passively enabled by default. You'll need to click the Add-In on your toolbar to select and save your color preferences for your calendar as they default to off.
